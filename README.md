# Fashionist: Personalising Outfit Recommendation for Cold-Start Scenarios

With the proliferation of the online fashion industry, there have been increased efforts towards building cutting-edge solutions for personalising fashion recommendation. Despite this, the technology is still limited by its poor performance on new entities, i.e. the cold-start problem. We attempt to address the cold-start problem for new users, by leveraging a novel visual preference modelling approach on a small set of input images. Additionally, we describe our proposed strategy to incorporate the modelled preference in occasion-oriented outfit recommendation. Finally, we propose Fashionist: a real-time web application to demonstrate our approach enabling personalised and diverse outfit recommendation for cold-start scenarios.
